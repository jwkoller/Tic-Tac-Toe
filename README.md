# Tic-Tac-Toe
Classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe played on the console, player enters numbers for row and column. This program was an exercise from my current text book <i>Introduction to Java: Programming and Data Structures</i> 11th Edition by Y. Daniel Liang on page 310. I expanded upon the exercise by moving the game to a separate class, as well as adding multiple types of user input validation.
